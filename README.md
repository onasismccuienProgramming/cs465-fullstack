# Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?  the <P> symbol represents a paragraph, or text.  This allows you to name your page, or place infomration where you would like.  For sing page application, I saw how json format was returned when a request was made.  MongoDB was used because it has more flexibility.  It can handle more data as far as space is concerned.

# Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.  So, the whole premise of jason, is to allow things like partial updates.  Basically, you only want to refresh one change, and not the entire page.  This is what makes json so valuable.  

# Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.  So, a client can request data about a resource.  The server will respond by sending a client buy sending the iformation back to them.  The client can select to have the information sent to them in json format if they wish.  You can run Node.js to test your program.  You can run angular testing.  You can apply the MEAN, MERN, etc, to apply testing.

# Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?  I have a good understanding of full stack front, and back end.  I have been literally walked through on how to create a webpage using visual studio.  I also see how javascript plays a role in the creation of websites.  I understand how to apply CSS's and html to the backend of websites.  I understand how to manipulate background color, font, and I can even create different classes in order to make changes to certain text that I so choose.
